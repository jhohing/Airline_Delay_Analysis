# Airline_Delay_Analysis

## Domain Background: 
This project has been inherited from The Airline Domain. In Airline, if you want to travel or anyone who wants to travel, he must book the flight from one place to another. 

There are number of factors, which can impact the flight journey like Weather, flight departure time, boarding gate time and departure time etc. Keeping these factors in mind, we can decide that particular aircraft can be landed or arrive on time or not or how much it will be delay.  

Every airline has their flight history past journey, which can help them in predicting future flight delay. We can implement a machine learning model, which will help us in the prediction of a flight delay. 

The Motivation behind this project is to optimization of network operation, ground staff management and passenger. 

## Data Set
Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.

## Problem Statement: 
Flight delays are a common occurrence in the airline industry, causing significant inconvenience and frustration for passengers. Despite efforts to improve airline operations and reduce delays, they continue to impact the travel experience and cost the industry billions of dollars each year. An analysis of flight delays could involve examining various factors that contribute to delays, such as:
- **Weather conditions**: Extreme weather conditions such as storms, heavy rain, snow, and fog can cause flight delays or cancellations.
- **Air traffic congestion**: Busy airports and crowded airspace can cause delays in takeoff and landing.
- **Technical issues**: Technical issues with aircraft or equipment can cause delays, as well as maintenance or repair work.
- **Crew issues**: Delays can occur if there is a shortage of pilots or flight attendants, or if they are delayed or unavailable due to sickness, injury, or other reasons.
- **Security issues**: Security checks and procedures can cause delays, especially during high-security situations.

Analyzing flight delay data can provide insights into patterns and trends, such as the busiest times of year or the most common reasons for delays. This information can help airlines and airport operators to develop strategies for managing delays and improving the overall travel experience for passengers. It can also inform policy decisions related to air travel, such as regulations related to airport capacity or airline operations.
