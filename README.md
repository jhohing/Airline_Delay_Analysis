# Airline_Delay_Analysis

## Domain Background: 
This project has been inherited from The Airline Domain. In Airline, if you want to travel or anyone who wants to travel, he must book the flight from one place to another. 

There are number of factors, which can impact the flight journey like Weather, flight departure time, boarding gate time and departure time etc. Keeping these factors in mind, we can decide that particular aircraft can be landed or arrive on time or not or how much it will be delay.  

Every airline has their flight history past journey, which can help them in predicting future flight delay. We can implement a machine learning model, which will help us in the prediction of a flight delay. 

The Motivation behind this project is to optimization of network operation, ground staff management and passenger.  

## Problem Statement: 

This problem is related to the flight operation department of Airline Industry. Flight is flying from source to destination, sometimes it’s reaching on time, sometimes it is reaching with some delay. This Delay in the journey can impact many things like it can block airline’s resource and in Respect to the passenger, they can miss their meetings etc. 

Flight delay prediction means, how much time was estimated for journey and how much time aircraft took to reach from Origin to Destination.  
 
It’s a binary classification problem. We will classify that the upcoming flight will reach on time or will it be the delay to reach destination airport. For overcoming this problem, we will drive a Supervised Classification Machine Learning.
