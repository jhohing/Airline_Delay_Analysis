# Airline_Delay_Analysis

## Domain Background: 
This project has been inherited from The Airline Domain. In Airline, if you want to travel or anyone who wants to travel, he must book the flight from one place to another. 

There are number of factors, which can impact the flight journey like Weather, flight departure time, boarding gate time and departure time etc. Keeping these factors in mind, we can decide that particular aircraft can be landed or arrive on time or not or how much it will be delay.  

Every airline has their flight history past journey, which can help them in predicting future flight delay. We can implement a machine learning model, which will help us in the prediction of a flight delay. 

The Motivation behind this project is to optimization of network operation, ground staff management and passenger.

## Problem Statement: 
Flight delays are a common occurrence in the airline industry, causing significant inconvenience and frustration for passengers. Despite efforts to improve airline operations and reduce delays, they continue to impact the travel experience and cost the industry billions of dollars each year. An analysis of flight delays could involve examining various factors that contribute to delays, such as:
- **Weather conditions**: Extreme weather conditions such as storms, heavy rain, snow, and fog can cause flight delays or cancellations.
- **Air traffic congestion**: Busy airports and crowded airspace can cause delays in takeoff and landing.
- **Technical issues**: Technical issues with aircraft or equipment can cause delays, as well as maintenance or repair work.
- **Crew issues**: Delays can occur if there is a shortage of pilots or flight attendants, or if they are delayed or unavailable due to sickness, injury, or other reasons.
- **Security issues**: Security checks and procedures can cause delays, especially during high-security situations.

Analyzing flight delay data can provide insights into patterns and trends, such as the busiest times of year or the most common reasons for delays. This information can help airlines and airport operators to develop strategies for managing delays and improving the overall travel experience for passengers. It can also inform policy decisions related to air travel, such as regulations related to airport capacity or airline operations. 

## Questions to answer
- How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?

- What percentage of flights in experienced a departure delay in 2015? Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?

- How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? 

- How many flights were cancelled in 2015? What % of cancellations were due to weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?

- Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure?

## Data Set
Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.
[Airline Flight Delays](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=ai).
This corpus has 4 csv files. 
-	flights.csv
- airports.csv
-	airline.csv
-	cancellation_codes.csv

For model prediction, we will use flights.csv. But for data insight, we will use other two also.

### Flights.csv
It contains all the past data related to flight schedule from source to destination. Which we will use in our model to test and train. It has 5819079 samples with 31 feature. As we are going to implement it as classification problem. We need to consider a sample per class.

## Machine Learning Project Design

Every Machine Learning Project have some steps to achieve the goal. Below the steps or action, we need to perform for any ML project. We will follow the same for this project 

### Language and Libraries 
-	Python 3.X 
-	Tensor flow  
-	Scikit-learn 

### Data Collection
For implementing a machine learning model, we need data. In our case, we will collect data in CSV format with `Flights.csv` wich contains all the data  we need for our purpose. 

### Feature Engineering 
Feature engineering is the main step in ML model designing. In this, we will do the feature analysis, which feature is more relevant and which are less impacting the outcome. We will use the column **Arrival delays** to cover our feature because our project is based on the analysis of the Airline Flight Delays. 

Dataset in flights.csv is high in volume(~5819079). For computing, it will require high computation power and time. So for this project we are going to use only one month data (July).

### Normalization
In feature Engineering, we will do feature normalization. So because of high magntiude one should not dominate another feature. 
It very important step in the machine learning model. It can drastically impact model performance.

### Train & Test Dataset 
We will Split the dataset into train and test, Training set we will use for our training and testing set for model validation. 

### Model Training & Testing 
By splitting the dataset into a train and test set, we can use the train set to build and train the model and then evaluate its performance on the test set. It is important to note that the train-test split should be done randomly to avoid bias and ensure that the test set is representative of the overall population.

### Model fitting 	
The main goal of fitting a model is to find the best set of parameters or weights that minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs of the training data. Once the model has been fit to the training data, it can be used to make predictions.

### Finalizing Model 
Selecting best final model for our purpose. For our project, we will 3 ML models to get the highest accuracy of prediction

### Data Visualization 
With the help of data visualization, we will try to get insight of data. In visualization, we can see the correlation in between features of data set like HeatMap, Scatter plot.
