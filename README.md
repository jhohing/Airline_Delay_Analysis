# Airline_Delay_Analysis

## Domain Background: 
This project has been inherited from The Airline Domain. In Airline, if you want to travel or anyone who wants to travel, he must book the flight from one place to another. 

There are number of factors, which can impact the flight journey like Weather, flight departure time, boarding gate time and departure time etc. Keeping these factors in mind, we can decide that particular aircraft can be landed or arrive on time or not or how much it will be delay.  

Every airline has their flight history past journey, which can help them in predicting future flight delay. We can implement a machine learning model, which will help us in the prediction of a flight delay. 

The Motivation behind this project is to optimization of network operation, ground staff management and passenger.
